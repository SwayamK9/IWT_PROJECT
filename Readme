# Vibestream – Responsive Music Platform

## Overview

Vibestream is a beginner-friendly, modern music platform website built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The platform is designed as a polished demo to showcase advanced UI/UX features found in popular streaming services—without streaming actual music. It combines fast navigation, interactive controls, real data, and real album art for an authentic look and feel.

## Key Features

- **Genre-Based Theme Switcher:**  
  Instantly changes the website’s color scheme and vibe (using CSS variables) based on the selected music genre—Romance, Hip-Hop, Rock, Classical, or EDM—for a dynamic user experience.

- **Real Songs and Covers:**  
  All music cards use real song titles, artists, and high-quality album cover images, organized by genre for maximum realism.

- **Integrated Music Player:**  
  A fixed player bar at the bottom displays the current song, including cover, name, and artist, as well as play/pause and skip controls. A functional progress/timer bar and a volume slider provide hands-on interactivity.

- **Simple Navigation:**  
  Easily switch between Home, Browse, Playlists, and Library pages via a persistent navigation menu.

- **Fully Responsive Design:**  
  The platform adapts to any device—from desktops to smartphones—thanks to CSS grid and media queries. All major features remain accessible and visually sharp on every screen size.

## Why Vibestream Stands Out

- **Visually Impressive:**  
  The instant theme system and real imagery give the entire site a lively, app-like look that’s easy to present or demo live.

- **Beginner-Friendly Code:**  
  The entire project is a single HTML file with no frameworks or dependencies, structured for learning or further expansion with clear logic and comments.

- **Easy to Extend:**  
  New songs or genres can be added by simply copying and editing existing blocks—no complex setup required.

## Perfect For

- Rapid UI/UX demos or client pitches
- Prototyping or portfolio pieces in web development
- Academic/classroom demonstration of real-world web practices
- Anyone wanting to learn modern HTML, CSS variables, JavaScript event handling, and responsive design
